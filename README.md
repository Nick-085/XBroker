## About the Project
XBroker is a project designed to be an alternative to Citrix VDI and Omnissa Horizon. It uses Xen Orchestra and Apache Guacamole to clone a template VM, start it, and assign it to the requesting user. The ultimate goal is for this project to be ported to as many hypervisor platforms as possible.
